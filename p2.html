			My first attempt to build and understand what a basic 
			computer is and also a first step in the field of Computer Architecture :)
			The project demonstrates what it takes for some design in the 
			wild, to be called, a valid computer.<br><br>

			It is a beginner friendly, turing complete, 8-bit programable computer with 
			16-byte primary memory(RAM) and 16 possible machine instructions
			in it's instruction set.
			It features a single 8-bit bus for data transfer and two 8-bit 
			general purpose registers.<br><br>

			At the core of it's ALU lies a simple 8-bit ripple carry adder 
			which allows the machine to perform basic arithmetics like addition and subtraction.<br>
			As mentioned before, their are 16 possible machine instructions of which 11 are
			implemented. Each instruction is 5 clock cycles long, 2 clock cycles for instruction 
			fetch and 3 for actual execution of the instruction.<br><br><br>

			<strong>A detailed documentation and block diagram is available over at github.
				Check it out if you are interested.</strong>
