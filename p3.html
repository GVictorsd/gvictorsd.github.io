			A project which aims to explore the genius one of the error correction
			codes called the Hamming codes, designed by Richard Hamming at Bell labs.
			It is used to detect and correct potential errors that might occur 
			during any digital data transfer protocol.<br><br>

			While data is being transmited via a medium or is being stored in some device, it may be corrupted 
			due to noise caused by the medium of transmision or by physical damage to 
			the storage devices. Error detection codes are used to, sort of, travel back 
			in time and get back the original data from the corrupted one.<br><br>

			This project implements a version called extended Hamming(15,11) code, a kind of hamming 
			code which uses 15 bits for storage, of which 11 are used to store actual data and 4 bits are 
			used as redundant bits to somehow encode the actual data. This scheme allows
			detection and correction of 1-bit errors. Two bit errors can be detected but can't be corrected.
