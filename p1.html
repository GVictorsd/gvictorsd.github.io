				An Emulator of the classic MOS6502 micro-computer which has been 
				around in 1970's-80's written in Verilog hdl.<br><br>

				Objective of this project is to understand how this simple yet
				powerful, 8-bit, commercially available processor worked at the gate
				level or may be simply to get a taste of what it feels to be a programmer
				working with voltage levels across various components in hardware.<br><br>

				The project features a 8-bit processor with a data bus, 2 8-bit address
				bus and a special bus used for data transfer. A 16 bit memory addressing is
				possible allowing a maximum of 65,535 bytes of primary memory(RAM).
				General purpose registers include an Accumulator, X and Y registers available
				for programmer.<br><br>

				The ALU is capable of performing arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction
				and bit operations like AND, OR, XOR, shift and rotate.<br><br>

				It also has an 8-bit status register and a stack pointer extending stack from
				0x0100 to 0x01FF in memory. The whole system works on a two-phase clock.<br><br><br>
